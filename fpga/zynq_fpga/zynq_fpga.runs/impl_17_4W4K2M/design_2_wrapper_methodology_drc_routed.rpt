LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell design_2_i/cpu_0/U0/mlite_cpu_inst/u8_mult/pc_reg[31]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) design_2_i/cpu_0/U0/mlite_cpu_inst/u1_pc_next/pc_reg_reg[10]/CLR,

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.003 ns between design_2_i/cpu_0/U0/mlite_cpu_inst/u2_mem_ctrl/opcode_reg_reg[28]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_2_i/cpu_0/U0/gen_cache.cache_cntrl_inst/block_rows_reg_r2_0_63_45_47/RAMA/WE (clocked by clk_fpga_0).
